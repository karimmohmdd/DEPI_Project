# Mental Health & Depressive Disorder Risk Analysis & Prediction

This project aims to analyze the impact of medical and lifestyle factors on the risk of depressive disorder and other mental health issues, and to build a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of developing depression based on individual behavioral and health indicators.

## 🔍 Project Overview
Using a dataset that includes features such as sleep duration, Concentrating Level, physical activity, social habits, alcohol/smoking status, Chronic diseases and medical history, we apply data science and machine learning techniques to:

- Discover patterns and correlations in mental health & lifestyle data
- Build and evaluate a depressive disorder prediction model
- Provide insights through visualizations and an interactive dashboard
- Deploy the model for practical predictive use to support early mental health assessment
