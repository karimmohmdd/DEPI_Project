Heart Disease Risk Analysis & Prediction

This project aims to analyze the impact of medical and lifestyle factors on heart disease risk, and to build a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of developing heart disease based on individual health indicators.

## 🔍 Project Overview
Using a dataset that includes features such as body weight, sleep duration, physical activity, smoking status, and medical history, we apply data science and machine learning techniques to:

- Discover patterns and correlations in lifestyle & health data
- Build and evaluate a heart disease prediction model
- Provide insights through visualizations and a dashboard
- Deploy the model for practical predictive use
